# GPFC.jl - Gaussian Process Force Constants

We aim to use Automatic Differentiation(AD) to evaluate the arbitrary order derivatives of Gaussian Processes(GPs). By taking derivatives of GPs, the GP model can be trained on energies and force fields in order to make a prediction of arbitrary order force constants(FCs).

A work in progress.
